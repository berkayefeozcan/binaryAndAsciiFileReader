abstract : 
Nowadays, it is very important to read data    from any data storage media in IT environments and to save data to these media. There are many databases in these environments. We have created a software that extracts the data from the 3D files that are the subject of this report according to the specified conditions and performs a series of transactions with these data respectively. The purpose of this software is not certain number of files, if there is no problem in the file, according to the conditions mentioned in the first five lines of the file we call the title information, if there are three points in the file with color information to draw from the file. After that, the user requests the transactions according to these points. When we test our software, we see that it performs these operations very successfully. 

This program basically reads binary and ascii data from files . After reading  data  program processes readable data .
